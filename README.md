# MyFlashcardApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5.

It is a simple flashcard application made with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To build the app so it can be used on an android device, you can clone [this repository](https://github.com/demarbre1u/MyFlashcardAppCordova), and then build the app like so :

`
ng build --prod --base-href . --output-path ../MyFlashcardAppCordova/www/
`

Once this is done, follow the instructions on the other repository to run your app on an android device.
